# This file lists libraries that we will assume to be present on the host system and hence
# should NOT be bundled inside AppImages. This is a working document; expect it to change
# over time. File format: one filename per line. Each entry should have a justification comment.

libGL.so.1
# Workaround for:
# Different distributions put dri/ libraries in different places, which are not found if we supply a bundled libGL.so.1
# /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/dri/swrast_dri.so
# /usr/lib64/dri/swrast_dri.so

libdrm.so.2
# Workaround for:
# Antergos Linux release 2015.11 (ISO-Rolling)
# /usr/lib/libdrm_amdgpu.so.1: error: symbol lookup error: undefined symbol: drmGetNodeTypeFromFd (fatal)
# libGL error: unable to load driver: swrast_dri.so
# libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
# Unrecognized OpenGL version

libxcb.so.1
# Workaround for:
# Fedora 23
# symbol lookup error: /lib64/libxcb-dri3.so.0: undefined symbol: xcb_send_fd
# Uncertain if this is required to be bundled for some distributions - if so we need to write a version check script and use LD_PRELOAD to load the system version if it is newer

libX11.so.6
# Workaround for:
# Fedora 23
# symbol lookup error: ./lib/libX11.so.6: undefined symbol: xcb_wait_for_reply64
# Uncertain if this is required to be bundled for some distributions - if so we need to write a version check script and use LD_PRELOAD to load the system version if it is newer

libgio-2.0.so.0
# Workaround for:
# On Ubuntu, "symbol lookup error: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gtk-2.0/modules/liboverlay-scrollbar.so: undefined symbol: g_settings_new"

libgdk-x11-2.0.so.0
libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0
# Simply to reduce size - not known to cause issues

libasound.so.2
# Workaround for:
# No sound, e.g., in VLC.AppImage (does not find sound cards)
