# Autodesk MeshMixer is available officially for Ubuntu only.
# Probably Fedora, CentOS, OpenSUSE,... users would like to see an AppImage
# and with this file you can produce one yourself until 
# Autodesk provides an official one for download. Just download Recipe and this file,
# then run, on an Ubuntu machine, bash ./Recipe ./MeshMixer.yml.
# The resulting AppImage should run on most distributions from 2014 and later.
