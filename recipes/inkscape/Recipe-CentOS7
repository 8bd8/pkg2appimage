# For now I have given up on building Inkscape on CentOS 6
# because it needs so many newer versions of the gdk/gtk/gdkmm/gtkmm dependencies
# Help would be greatly appreciated. In the meantime, I am using CentOS 7
# which means that the resulting AppImage will be compatible with fewer older systems
# CentOS-7.0-1406-x86_64-GnomeLive.iso
